Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  * If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself so I can ignore when I pull
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
